Started learning Django a few days back, here's what I learnt:<br />

<br />

1. Use `uv pip/pip3` (rapidly fast).<br />
2. How to create a virtual environment.<br />
3. Advantages of Django ([link](https://djangoproject.com)).<br />
4. If port is occupied, type `manage.py runserver 8001 (portno.)`.<br />
