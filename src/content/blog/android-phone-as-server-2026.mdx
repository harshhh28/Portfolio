This was a weekend experiment where I didn't want to pay cloud charges (at least not for hosting small projects and demos).
That's when I stumbled upon **Termux**, and it turned my Android phone into a usable mini-server.

This guide is **updated for 2026** and avoids outdated practices.


## What This Blog Covers

- Using your Android phone like a Linux server
- SSH access from your PC
- Running backend services (Node.js example)
- Exposing services securely (Cloudflare Tunnel)
- With **domain** and **without domain** approaches
- Optional: full Linux (Debian / Ubuntu) environment


## Why Use a Phone as a Server?

- Why pay cloud charges for small experiments?
- Learn real DevOps concepts (SSH, networking, tunnels)
- Repurpose an old or spare phone
- No port forwarding required
- Works even behind CGNAT
- Perfect for demos, side projects, and learning

This is **not a production replacement**, but it's good for learning and prototyping.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- Android phone (Android 8+ recommended)
- Stable internet (Wi-Fi preferred)
- PC (Windows / Linux / macOS)
- Basic terminal knowledge
- Optional: a domain name


## Step 1: Install Termux (Correct Way)

Termux provides a Linux-like environment on Android.

> Do **not** install Termux from the Play Store (deprecated).

### Install from F-Droid

- Download Termux from F-Droid:
  https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/

After opening Termux, update packages:

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```


## Step 2: Prepare Your Phone for SSH Access

Typing commands on a phone is painful.
Instead, we'll **SSH into the phone from a PC**.

### Install OpenSSH

```bash
pkg install openssh
```

### Set a password

```bash
passwd
```

### Start the SSH server

```bash
sshd
```

-   SSH runs on **port 8022** by default

Check your Termux username:

```bash
whoami
```

### Find your phone's local IP

```bash
ip addr show wlan0
```

Example:

```text
192.168.1.23
```


## Step 3: SSH Into Your Phone From PC

From **Linux / macOS / Windows**:

```bash
ssh -p 8022 <username>@192.168.1.23
```

Enter the password you set earlier.

You now have **remote shell access** to your phone.
If not, you messed something up, it's time to GPT your way out.

## Step 4: Run a Backend Service (Node.js Example)

Let's run a simple HTTP server.

### Install Node.js

```bash
pkg install nodejs
```

### Create a test server

```bash
mkdir test-server
cd test-server
nano server.js
```

```js
const http = require("http");
const PORT = 3000;
http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
  res.end("Server running on an Android phone\n");
}).listen(PORT, "127.0.0.1", () => {
  console.log("Server listening on port " + PORT);
});
```

Run it:

```bash
node server.js
```

Your phone is now acting as a **local backend server**.


## Step 5: Why Public Access Is Not Straightforward

Most mobile networks:

- Use **CGNAT**
- Block inbound connections
- Do not allow port forwarding

So direct exposure using public IP **will not work**.

### Solution: Cloudflare Tunnel

Cloudflare Tunnel creates a **secure outbound tunnel** from your phone to Cloudflare.
No public IP, no router configuration, HTTPS by default.

## Step 6: Install Cloudflared

```bash
pkg install cloudflared
```


## Step 7A: If You HAVE a Domain (Recommended)

### Important Note About Domains

If your domain is registered with providers like **Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains, etc.**:

-   You **must move your domain's DNS to Cloudflare**
-   This does **not** mean transferring ownership
-   Only nameservers are changed

Cloudflare Tunnel **requires Cloudflare DNS** to work with custom domains.


### Login to Cloudflare

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
```

This opens a browser where you:

-   Log in to Cloudflare
-   Select your domain
-   Authorize access


### Create a tunnel

```bash
cloudflared tunnel create test-server
```


### Create configuration file

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cloudflared
nano ~/.cloudflared/config.yml
```

```yaml
tunnel: <TUNNEL_ID>
credentials-file: ~/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL_ID>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: test.yourdomain.com
    service: http://localhost:3000
  - service: http_status:404
```


### Map DNS automatically

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns test-server test.yourdomain.com
```


### Run the tunnel

```bash
cloudflared tunnel run test-server
```

Now open:

```text
https://test.yourdomain.com
```

Your phone is live on the internet with HTTPS.


## Step 7B: If You DO NOT Have a Domain

You can still expose your service using a **temporary Cloudflare URL**.

Run:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

You'll get a URL like:

```text
https://random-name.trycloudflare.com
```

Characteristics:

-   No domain needed
-   HTTPS enabled
-   Temporary
-   URL changes on restart

Perfect for demos and quick testing.


## Step 8: (Optional) Get a Full Linux Feel (Debian / Ubuntu)

If Termux feels limited and you want a **real Linux filesystem and package ecosystem**, you can use `proot`.

### Install proot-distro

```bash
pkg install proot-distro
```

### Install Debian (recommended)

```bash
proot-distro install debian
```

Login:

```bash
proot-distro login debian
```

You now have:

-   `apt` package manager
-   Standard Linux directory structure
-   Near VPS-like experience

You can also install Ubuntu:

```bash
proot-distro install ubuntu
proot-distro login ubuntu
```

This is ideal if:

-   You want parity with cloud servers
-   You're testing deployment scripts
-   You want a true Linux dev environment


## Step 9: Power & Stability Tips

-   Disable battery optimization for Termux
-   Keep phone plugged in
-   Use `tmux` for long-running processes
-   Expect occasional restarts (it's still a phone)


## Security Notes

-   Prefer SSH keys over passwords
-   Never expose SSH directly to the internet
-   Cloudflare Tunnel is safer than port forwarding
-   Avoid storing sensitive secrets on the phone


## Final Thoughts

Your phone is more powerful than many old VPS machines.

With **Termux + SSH + Cloudflare Tunnel**, you can:
-   Treat your phone like a Linux server
-   Learn real-world networking
-   Host side projects without paying cloud bills

Sometimes, the best lab is already in your pocket.
