1. Fixed A LOT OF templating errors.<br />
2. Jinja2 makes the layout so damn smooth ([link](https://chaicode.com/blogs/jinja-templates-and-apps-in-django)).<br />
3. Creating apps (`urls(project)->urls(app)`, etc.).<br />
4. CSS and browser caching.<br />

<br />

So, it took me more than an hour to debug why my CSS was not getting loaded even after changing and saving it 10 times! I tried many approaches including:<br />

1. Adding `STATICFILES_STORAGE`.<br />
2. Adding (update cache) `MIDDLEWARES`.<br />

<br />

But none worked.  
In the end, I got it solved by adding `?v={{ STATIC_VERSION }}` after `{% static 'style.css' %}`.<br />

<br />

### What it does?<br />

It helps bust the cached (old version of your CSS) and forces the browser to download the latest version.<br />
