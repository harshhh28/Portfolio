## Http Module vs Express

If the `http` module were a person:

- No frills, just raw power.
- Want routing? Do it yourself.
- Loves simplicity but makes you work for it.
- Use it if you want to feel like a true Node.js ninja.

On the other hand, Express is like that friend who:

- Handles your plans (routing) effortlessly.
- Brings snacks (middleware) to every party.
- Speeds things up and makes you look good.
- Why work hard when Express makes it easy?
