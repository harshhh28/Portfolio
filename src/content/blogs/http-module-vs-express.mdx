## **Http Module vs Express**<br />

<br />

If the `http` module were a person:<br />

- No frills, just raw power.<br />
- Want routing? Do it yourself.<br />
- Loves simplicity but makes you work for it.<br />
- Use it if you want to feel like a true Node.js ninja.<br />

<br />

On the other hand, **Express** is like that friend who:<br />

- Handles your plans (routing) effortlessly.<br />
- Brings snacks (middleware) to every party.<br />
- Speeds things up and makes you look good.<br />
- Why work hard when Express makes it easy?<br />
