## **GST and Popcorn: A Love Story**

<br />

Ever wondered why some people don’t buy popcorn at the theater? Because GST is in love with popcorn, and every flavor gets its own "princess" treatment.

<br />

### **Normal Popcorn: 5% GST**

This one’s like your childhood love. Simple, straightforward, and low-maintenance.

<br />

### **Salted Popcorn: 12% GST**

Things are getting serious here. Turns out, sprinkling salt is now a luxury move. It’s a salty affair.

<br />

### **Caramelized Popcorn: 18% GST**

This is the Bollywood drama of popcorn. High-maintenance, over-the-top, and definitely expensive.
