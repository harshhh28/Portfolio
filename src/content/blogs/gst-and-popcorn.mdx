## GST and Popcorn: A Love Story

Ever wondered why some people don’t buy popcorn at the theater? Because GST is in love with popcorn, and every flavor gets its own "princess" treatment.

### Normal Popcorn: 5% GST

This one’s like your childhood love. Simple, straightforward, and low-maintenance.

### Salted Popcorn: 12% GST

Things are getting serious here. Turns out, sprinkling salt is now a luxury move. It’s a salty affair.

### Caramelized Popcorn: 18% GST

This is the Bollywood drama of popcorn. High-maintenance, over-the-top, and definitely expensive.

### Finance Minister's Logic

"As the flavor gets richer, so does the GST." We just wanted some snacks, not a tax lesson.

### A Plea from the People

"Dear GST Council, please don’t make popcorn so expensive that we forget the joy of eating it while watching a love story in a theatre."

### In the End

The love story between GST and popcorn is like every complicated romance—confusing, expensive, and impossible to understand.
